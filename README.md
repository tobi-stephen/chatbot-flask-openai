## Simple Chatbot

The project is a minimalist implementation of a chatbot assistant that exposes two APIs
- setting some context and providing data source for grounding
- asking the assistant question based on the contexts that was previously used

It uses the following tools
- openai
- langchain for easier bootstrapping of prompts
- flask for the web interface
